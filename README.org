This tool connects to your Exchange server and extracts data
in Org-mode format.

Please do note that this is a TEMPORARY stand-alone tool which will
be added to Memacs as an module as soon as Memacs got migrated to
Python 3:   https://github.com/novoid/memacs/

You can configure the behavior and output via a configuration file.

Example usages:
  exchange2org.py --calendar some/subfolder/my_exchange_calendar.org
      … writes your calendar events into the Org-mode file.
