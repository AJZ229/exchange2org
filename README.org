You can configure the behavior and output via a configuration file.

Example usages:
  ./exchange2org.py --calendar some/subfolder/my_exchange_calendar.org
      … writes your calendar events into the Org-mode file.

positional arguments:
  FILE           The filename of the output file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  --calendar     Extract the calendar as Org-mode events.

                 anything
